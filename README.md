# dumbshell
an extremely unintuitive shell

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boronhub/dumbshell/master/logo.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>

- no command does what it's meant to do
- there is absolutely no error handling or reporting
- a wide array of colors that mean absolutely nothing
- next to no information about anything displayed
- protip: for extra dumbness, use this with suicide linux
